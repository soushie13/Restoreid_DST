"""Compatibility shim for chatlas types not yet public in chatlas.types.

ContentPDF was added to chatlas.types in chatlas 0.19.0. Until our minimum
chatlas version exceeds 0.18.0, we fall back to the private import path.

When pyproject.toml requires chatlas > 0.18.0, delete this file and import
ContentPDF directly from chatlas.types everywhere.
